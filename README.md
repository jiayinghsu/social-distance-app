## Introduction 
Studies of decision-making in social contexts have relied heavily on the simplifying assumption that people are narrowly self-interested. However, much empirical evidence has shown that people exhibit a wide range of social preferences when choosing unilaterally among interdependent options. During the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest among researchers in measuring the magnitude of an individual's concern towards others. While several measurement methods have been developed, we designed a new measure of social preferences with several advantages over the best existing alternative. Here we present a new measurement method by creating this Social Distance App and provide evidence for its solid psychometric properties. We show that our measure is highly efficient, valid, reliable, and sensitive and could benefit many research streams. We extend our invitation to other researchers to use [this new measure](http://experiments.evullab.org/social-distance-app/#/).
